\chapter{Development tasks for initial prototype}

\section{Tasks}

\subsection*{Database maintenance}
Clearing tables older than x days, transfer of data to data warehouse.

\subsection*{UC2: Sensor and prediction data from FTP}
\subsubsection{Task: Database schema for predictions}
DB schema and access through \texttt{DBManager}.

\subsubsection{Task: FTPAdapter}
Implement an \texttt{FTPAdapter}. Store measurements and predictions in DB, avoiding duplication.

\subsection*{UC3: Scheduled ControlAction is executed}
\subsubsection{Task: Initial version of Controller framework}
Initial \texttt{ControllerManager}, dummy \texttt{ControlStrategy, Controller}.

\subsubsection{Task: VentilationControllerAdapter}
Communicate with ventilation system using HTTP.

\subsubsection{Task: Execute scheduled action}
Read a scheduled action from DB and actuate ventilation controller.

\subsection*{UC5: ControlStrategy schedules action(s)}
\subsubsection{Task: Simple ControlStrategy}
Simple \texttt{ControllerStrategy} which schedules ventilation system to run at lower setting at night.


\section{Summary}
The above covers acquiring measurements from RabbitMQ, predictions and measurements from FTP and scheduling actions for controlling the ventilation system.
